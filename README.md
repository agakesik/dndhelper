# DnD helper

Small project created as a exercise while learning react native

## Description of application
Simple tracking of features and atributes in dnd games, for example used spells

* player has a number of features, depending on their character's class and race
* each of the feature can be used limited number of times
* each feature is reseted after either short or long rest

## Goal of application
* easier tracking than writing and wiping off in notebook or character's sheet
* easier resetting: with one button, not manualing reseting each feature
* clear view on which feature restes after a short rest and which after a long rest
